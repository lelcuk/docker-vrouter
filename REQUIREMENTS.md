# Docker vRouter Requirements

## Project Overview
A production-ready containerized routing solution that enables communication between Docker Compose stacks using VXLAN technology, without external dependencies.

## Core Concept - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- Deploy a router container in each Docker Compose stack
- Enable inter-stack communication through VXLAN tunnels
- Pure Linux networking solution (no external tools)
- Support for both single-container and privilege-separated architectures

## Architecture

### Current Implementation Status

#### Single Container Architecture (IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- **Router Container**: All-in-one VXLAN management and routing
- **Network Mode**: `host` (required for VXLAN operations)
- **Privileges**: `privileged: true` (required for network interface manipulation)
- **Capabilities**: VXLAN interface creation, FDB management, route installation

#### Privilege-Separated Architecture (IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- **Discovery Container**: Privileged VXLAN interface management
- **Router Container**: Unprivileged routing operations only
- **Security**: Clear separation of privileged and unprivileged operations
- **Communication**: Shared volume for discovery data exchange

#### Two-Container Design (LEGACY SPECIFICATION)

#### 1. Discovery Container (Control Plane) - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- Runs with `network_mode: host`
- ~~Implements Gossip or Multicast protocol~~ (Static configuration used)
- ~~Discovers other stacks across the network~~ (Manual peer configuration)
- Maintains mapping: Physical IP ↔ VXLAN endpoints ✅
- Shares discovery data with Router Container ✅

#### 2. Router Container (Data Plane) - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- Dual-homed network configuration:
  - **Bridge Interface**: Connected to Docker Compose stack's bridge network ✅
  - **VXLAN Interface**: Tunnel endpoint in the container ✅
- Consumes discovery data from Discovery Container ✅
- Implements static routing based on configuration file ✅
- Routes traffic between local services and remote stacks ✅

### Bootstrap Process - IMPLEMENTED ✅
1. **Container Startup**:
   - Detect underlying host network interface (e.g., eth0, ens3) ✅
   - Obtain host's public IP address ✅
   - Create VXLAN interface bound to host's public interface ✅
   - Join the Docker Compose bridge network ✅
   
2. **Internal Routing**:
   - Router's bridge IP becomes the gateway for all services in the stack ✅
   - Services route inter-stack traffic through the router container ✅
   - Router forwards traffic to VXLAN based on destination ✅

### Key Components

#### 1. VXLAN Overlay Network - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- Create VXLAN tunnels between router containers ✅
- Each stack gets a unique VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI) ✅
- VXLAN endpoints must be discoverable across stacks ✅
- **Interface naming**: vxlan1000 for VNI 1000 ✅
- **FDB management**: All-zeros MAC entries for peer discovery ✅
- **Learning enabled**: Required for proper VXLAN operation ✅

#### 2. Service Discovery & Coordination - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
**Core Challenge**: Dynamic discovery in ephemeral environments
- ~~Containers may move between hosts~~ (Static deployment supported)
- ~~Host IPs may change~~ (Static IP configuration required)
- ~~Stacks may scale up/down~~ (Manual scaling supported)
- ~~No central coordination point~~ (Manual configuration required)

**Required Information per Stack** - IMPLEMENTED ✅:
- Current host's public IP address ✅
- VXLAN endpoint configuration ✅
- Stack network subnet(s) ✅
- VNI assignment ✅
- Stack identifier/name ✅

#### 3. Routing Configuration - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- Static routes between connected stacks ✅
- ~~Route propagation when new stacks join~~ (Manual configuration)
- ~~Handle stack removal/updates~~ (Manual configuration)
- ~~Update routes when containers migrate~~ (Static deployment only)

## Technical Requirements

### Container Capabilities - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- NET_ADMIN capability for network configuration ✅

- **Alternative**: Privilege separation with unprivileged router ✅

### Configuration Needs - IMPLEMENTED ✅
1. **Per-Stack Configuration**:
   - Stack identifier/name ✅
   - VXLAN VNI ✅
   - Local network subnet(s) ✅
   
2. **Global Configuration**:
   - Discovery mechanism (options):
     - Shared volume with configuration files ✅
     - Environment variables with peer information ✅
     - ~~Multicast discovery (if supported by Docker network)~~ (Not implemented)
   - **Current**: Docker configs for static configuration ✅
   
### Routing Logic - IMPLEMENTED ✅
1. On container startup:
   - Create VXLAN interface ✅
   - Configure IP addresses ✅
   - Discover peer routers ✅ (Static configuration)
   - Establish VXLAN tunnels ✅
   - Add static routes to remote networks ✅

2. Runtime operations:
   - ~~Monitor for new/removed stacks~~ (Static configuration)
   - ~~Update routing tables dynamically~~ (Static configuration)
   - ~~Health checking of VXLAN tunnels~~ (Basic connectivity only)

## Implementation Considerations

### Bootstrap Challenges

1. **Host Network Detection**:
   - Need to identify the correct public interface (eth0, ens3, etc.)
   - Must work across different host configurations
   - Handle multiple interfaces gracefully

2. **Dynamic Environment**:
   - Containers migrate between hosts
   - Host IPs may change (cloud environments)
   - Stacks appear/disappear dynamically
   - No persistent storage guaranteed

### Discovery Mechanisms (addressing subnet limitations):

**Standard Approaches (considered but rejected)**:
- **BGP-EVPN**: Industry standard for VXLAN control plane
  - Pros: Mature, handles all routing scenarios
  - Cons: Massive complexity, requires BGP daemon, overkill for this use case

**Subnet Limitation Problem**:
- **Gossip/Multicast**: Limited to same subnet/broadcast domain
- **Multi-subnet environments**: Common in cloud/enterprise deployments
- **NAT traversal**: Discovery must work across NAT boundaries
- **Security isolation**: Complete network isolation between discovery and routing

**Robust Discovery Solutions**:

1. **Hierarchical Discovery**:
   - **Local Discovery**: Gossip/Multicast within subnet
   - **Inter-Subnet Discovery**: Configured relay nodes
   - **Bootstrap Nodes**: Well-known endpoints for initial contact
   - Handles multi-subnet, multi-datacenter scenarios

2. **Relay-Based Discovery**:
   - Designated discovery relay nodes
   - Stacks register with multiple relays for redundancy
   - Relays exchange information between subnets
   - Automatic failover if relay nodes fail

3. **Distributed Discovery with Rendezvous**:
   - DHT-based peer discovery
   - Rendezvous points for initial bootstrap
   - Consistent hashing for scalability
   - Works across complex network topologies

4. **Hybrid Push-Pull Model**:
   - Push: Periodic announcements to known peers
   - Pull: Query relay nodes for peer updates
   - Combines local efficiency with global reach
   - Handles network partitions gracefully

5. **External Discovery Service** (for enterprise):
   - Lightweight HTTP/gRPC service
   - Stack registration and peer queries
   - Can be deployed redundantly
   - Handles authentication and authorization

### Proposed Solution: Two-Container Architecture

Given the complexity of BGP-EVPN and subnet limitations, we propose a **Two-Container Architecture** with complete network isolation:

**Core Concept**:
- **Discovery Container**: Runs with host networking, handles peer discovery
- **Router Container**: Isolated networking, handles data plane routing
- **Communication**: Shared volume only, no network communication between containers

**Security Benefits**:
- Complete network isolation between control and data planes
- No breach in network traffic between containers
- Discovery container can't access internal stack networks
- Router container can't access external discovery networks

**Implementation Approach**:

1. **Discovery Container (Control Plane)**:
   - Runs with `network_mode: host`
   - Implements robust discovery protocols
   - Handles multi-subnet, NAT traversal scenarios
   - Writes discovery data to shared volume
   - No access to stack internal networks

2. **Router Container (Data Plane)**:
   - Dual-homed: bridge network + VXLAN interface
   - Reads discovery data from shared volume
   - Combines with static routing configuration
   - Handles packet forwarding only
   - No external network discovery capabilities

3. **Shared Volume Communication**:
   - `/var/lib/docker-router/discovery.json` - Peer information
   - `/var/lib/docker-router/routes.json` - Generated routes
   - `/var/lib/docker-router/events.log` - Status updates
   - File locking for atomic updates

4. **Multi-Subnet Discovery**:
   - Hierarchical discovery with relay nodes
   - Bootstrap configuration for initial peers
   - Handles complex network topologies
   - Works across NAT boundaries

### Security
- VXLAN traffic encryption (optional)
- Peer authentication via shared secrets
- Access control lists for inter-stack communication

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Logging of routing changes
- VXLAN tunnel status
- Peer discovery events
- Traffic statistics
- Health endpoints

## Critical Questions

1. **Initial Discovery**: How does the first router in a new stack find existing routers?
2. **Network Partitions**: How to handle split networks?
3. **Stale Routes**: How to detect and remove routes for dead stacks?
4. **Migration Handling**: How quickly to detect container migrations?
5. **Scale Limits**: Maximum number of interconnected stacks?
